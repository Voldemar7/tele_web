# My Django website project

___

This project contains a page with two buttons: "Register" and "Login".

## Registration

By clicking on the "Register" button, the user is redirected to the Telegram bot for registration. After successful registration, the user receives a username and password.

## Login

By clicking on the "Login" button, the user is redirected to the login page where they can enter the received login and password. After successful login, the user is redirected to the main page of the site, where the data about him taken from the database will be displayed.

To develop this project, we used the Django framework and the Python programming language.
